	In order to determine which of the features Year, Gross or Number of female actors is most important, we fitted models excluding one or more of the features. Using a logistic regression model with LASSO (L1) regularization, we found that the model performance in terms of prediction accuracy was completely unaffected by removing either or both of the features Year and Gross. On the other hand, any model that excluded the variable Proportion of words female (which contains all information about how much male and female actors speak), had its performance reduced drastically. As seen in Table \ref{tab:logreg_table_90}, the model including all features had an accuracy of 90\%. This dropped to 80\% when removing the Proportion of words female. Comparing this to the null accuracy of 75.6\%, we conclude that the Proportion of words female is a very important feature in the model.
	
	The same results hold for both QDA and k-NN as well, the models are completely unaffected by removing either Year or Gross (or both), while suffering 8\% accuracy loss for k-NN and 12\% loss for QDA. Further, not only accuracy is affected but AUC is affected in the same way, showing that Year and Gross are more or less redundant features in the model, while Proportion of words female is incredibly important for predicting whether the lead is male or female.
