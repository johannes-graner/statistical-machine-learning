	We have chosen to focus on approaches using logistic regression, k-NN, LDA and QDA to classify the lead actor's gender.
	
	In order to make the methods as comparable as possible, we have used a common set of transformations of the input variables for all tested methods.
	
	To compare between families of models and between which tuning is better we chose to focus on two measures: accuracy (on average, of how often model makes a correct prediction) and AUC (area under ROC curve).
