	Based on the results we draw the conclusion that $k$-NN is the worst performing model of the ones considered. Neverthesless, it is worth noting the drastic effect that data transformations has on the $k$-NN model. Before transformations the model performed at the level of the baseline model, after the transformations we saw a accuracy of $0.882$ and a AUC of $0.901$ which is found in Table \ref{tab:k_nn_table_20}. The logistic regression model slightly outperformed $k$-NN. Looking at the best performing setup we see that logistic regression had an accuracy of $0.898$ and AUC $0.923$ which is seen in Table \ref{tab:logreg_table_90}. The LDA model had an accuracy of $0.903$ which is only a $0.005$ increase from the logistic regression model. Taking variance into account, we draw the conclusion that we can not say with any confidence which model performs better. The QDA model performs best among all considered models by a margin with an accuracy of $0.945$ and $0.984$ AUC according to the bootstrap test and accuracy $0.949$ according to the cross validation.
