	It seems like $k$-NN was the worst performing of the models worth noting is the drastic effect that data transformations has on the $k$-NN model, performing at the same level as the baseline model before any transformations. Since the model is somewhat "blind" to feature importance and is greatly affected by variances in the data. Normalization of the data is thus crucial for good results.
