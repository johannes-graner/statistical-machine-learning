	It seems like $k$-NN was the worst performing of the models worth noting is the drastic effect that data transformations has on the $k$-NN model, performing at the same level as the baseline model before any transformations. The best results for the $k$-NN were an Accuracy score of $0.882$ and an AUC Score of $0.901$ which is found in table . $k$-NN was slighty outperformed by the Logistic regression which in the best performing setup had an accuracy score of $0.898$ and an AUC score of $0.923$. LDA had an accuracy score of $0.903$ which is only a $0.5\%$ increase from the logistic regression case, considering that both the results from logistic regression and LDA had some variance we cannot reject that LDA and logistic regression performance is similar.
