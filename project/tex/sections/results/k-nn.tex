	When hyper-tuning the algorithm the set of $p$-values and $k$-values were given by $\{1,1.25,1.5,...,4\}$ and $\{1,2,3,...,25\}$ respectively. The number of folds used in cross-validation was again set to 10. It was found that $p = 2$ (Euclidean distance) and $k = 4$ performed best for our data set. Using these parameters the k-NN algorithm was tested and performance was measured with the mean of 100 bootstraps samples as before, the size of the sample was chosen with regards to k-NN being computationally demanding. The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:k_nn_table_10} and Table \ref{tab:k_nn_table_20} below.

	It is obvious that k-NN is drastically improved by transforming the data, before transformations the model performance was even outperformed by, or just slightly better than the best null model. Weighted k-NN with the \textit{distance} weight seemed to perform better than the \textit{uniform} weight both before and after the transformation, the impact seems to be $0.7-0.8\%$ extra accuracy after transformation and almost $3\%$ extra accuracy before transformations.
