	When comparing different models, it is important to have a baseline, or a null model to compare against. In this case, an obvious null model is the constant model that always predicts the same outcome regardless of input. The best null model is the one with highest accuracy, i.e. the constant model that predicts the most frequently occurring outcome. The model that always predicts a male lead has an accuracy of 0.756 and is thus chosen as the baseline.
